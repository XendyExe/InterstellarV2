# Interstellar V2
Interstellar is a modloader for [Deep Space Airships](https://drednot.io/). This repo contain the source code for Interstellar, along with how I build Interstellar. Interstellar is primarily made of three parts, the "decompiler", actual extension, and the "compiler". Those who are wishing to download Interstellar, please see the discord page.

## Running the Interstellar Dev server:
The Interstellar server requires Python and node. Run decompiler.py before running main.py to cache the game files. The server will automatically recompile the game upon any asset changes or changes in the Interstellar folder.

More will likely be added to this README when I actually get around to writing documentation.
